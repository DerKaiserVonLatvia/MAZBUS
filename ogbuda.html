				better known by his stage name OG Buda, is a Russian hip-hop artist, songwriter, actor, freestyler,<br>
				member of the RNDM Crew and Melon Music creative associations.<br>

				I rapped with friends in a fictitious language, and recorded my first track at the age of eight.<br> At the age of 14-16 he did it as a hobby.
